Speech commands classification with recurrent neural networks

The file `Speech_commands_classification_with_recurrent_neural_networks.pdf` is the report explaining used architectures, showing obtained results and comparisons.


Dataset: Speech Commands Dataset

 - test and compare different network architectures (at least one of them should be Long short-term memory (LSTM))
 - investigate influence of parameters change on the obtained results
 - present confusion matrix (with appropriate discussion)
 - in case of accuracy or efficiency problem a subset of classes can be selected and tested (e.g. only “yes” and “no” commands)
 - please pay special attention on “silence” and “unknown” classes - test different approaches (e.g. separate network for their recognition)
